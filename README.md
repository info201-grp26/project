### Project Description 
- our group uses the Washington State's dataset for occupation by region (2018) 
from [database](data.wa.gov) provided by **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics**. 
This dataset represents the occupational employment and wage estimates for regions in Washington and the state as a whole. It has 12 columns, notably: region, occupation, average wage and annual wage. 

- We are targeting an audience who’s willing to learn more about jobs in the state of Washington including ob hunters, college students, lawmakers, or anyone who’s interested in finding a good place to work. 

- Through our project, we want the audience to gain more **insights** of
  1. Which area in Washington has the highest average hourly income?
  2. Which occupations have the highest average hourly incomes?
  3. Which occupation is most popular in each region?
  4. Which area(s) have the most variability in hourly incomes?
  5. Do metropolitan areas have higher wages than non-metropolitan areas?


### Technical Analysis 
**Data**
The data we used from [washington government](data.wa.gov) can be accessed as a `.json` file that is publicly available. It is also available through a `R` package called `RSocrata`. We also conducted conversions for the 
dataset to be in `.csv` files that are acceptable by `R`.
